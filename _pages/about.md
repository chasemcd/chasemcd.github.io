I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University currently pursuing a [Ph.D. in Cognitive Decision Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/graduate/index.html). In December 2022, I received an [M.S. in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and before that a degree in Computational Social Science (through the [individual major program](https://www.honors.ucla.edu/other-programs/design-your-own-major/)) from UCLA. I am interested in cooperative artificial intelligence and the design of human-compatible autonomous systems. In my work, I ask how we can design AI to complement human decision-making and improve human experiences.

In tandem with my graduate studies, I am a member of Riot Games' Game AI team, where I conduct applied research in multi-agent (deep) reinforcement learning.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
