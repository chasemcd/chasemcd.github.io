My name is Chase McDonald and I'm currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am pursuing a [Ph.D. in Cognitive Decision Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/graduate/index.html) and an [M.S. in Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). My research focuses on both empirical and simulated multi-agent systems and their connections to artificial intelligence and cognitive science. In particular, I am interested in cooperative artificial intelligence and the design of human-compatible autonomous systems. In my current work, I aim to use insights about human behavior to inform the development of such systems.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
