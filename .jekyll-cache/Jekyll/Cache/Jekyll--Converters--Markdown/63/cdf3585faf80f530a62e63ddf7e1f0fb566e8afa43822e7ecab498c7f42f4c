I"€<p>My name is Chase McDonald and I am a PhD student in Cognitive Decision Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on both empirical and simulated multi-agent systems and their connections to artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and decision-making. In particular, I am interested in cooperative artificial intelligence and the design of autonomous systems that can work with and improve the experience humans. My research involves analyzing datasets of human decision-making, cognitive modeling, and reinforcement learning.</p>
