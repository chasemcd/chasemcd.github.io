<p>My name is Chase McDonald and I am a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/">Social and Decision Sciences</a> PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary focus is on both empirical and simulated multi-agent systems and their connections to artificial (social) intelligence, (social) cognition, and (social) decision-making.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I received my undergraduate degree from UCLA in Computational Social Science through an <a href="http://www.honors.ucla.edu/other-programs/design-your-own-major/#">Individual Field of Concentration</a> major. The degree culminated with a thesis that explored the emergence of inter- and intra-group norms under discrimination in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems.  <br /></p>
