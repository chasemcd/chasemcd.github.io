I"<p>Hi :wave:</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Shantam</strong>. This blog will contain my attempts to replicate/emulate the visualizations at large media houses, related to COVID-19 pandemic, using open source data &amp; tools.</p>

<p>I am a driven <strong>python</strong> developer and <strong>data scientist</strong>. I have worked with <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Big Data</strong> too. Did I tell you I am a published <strong>poet</strong> too?</p>

<p>I am available for <strong>consulting</strong>, <strong>collaborations</strong>, <strong>part time</strong> or <strong>full time</strong> jobs. Let me know if you want to talk.</p>

<p>If you want me to try a specific visualization, do let me know by raising an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/armsp/covidviz">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
