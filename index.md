My name is Chase McDonald and I am a PhD student in [Cognitive Decision Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on both empirical and simulated multi-agent systems and their connections to artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and decision-making.

<br/>

I received my undergraduate degree from UCLA in Computational Social Science through an [Individual Field of Concentration](http://www.honors.ucla.edu/other-programs/design-your-own-major/#) major.
