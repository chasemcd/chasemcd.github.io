# Welcome!
<br/>

My name is Chase McDonald and I am a [Social and Decision Sciences](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/) PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary focus is on multi-agent systems and the connections to artificial (social) intelligence, (social) cognition, and (social) decision-making.

<br/>

I received my undergraduate degree from UCLA in Computational Social Science through an [Individual Field of Concentration major](http://www.honors.ucla.edu/other-programs/design-your-own-major/#). The degree culminated with a thesis that explored the emergence of inter- and intra-group norms under discrimination in mutli-agent reinforcement learning systems.  <br/>
