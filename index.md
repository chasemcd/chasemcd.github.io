My name is Chase McDonald and I am a PhD student in [Cognitive Decision Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/)  
at Carnegie Mellon University. My primary focus is on both empirical and simulated multi-agent systems and their connections 
to artificial (social) intelligence, (social) cognition, and (social) decision-making.

<br/>

I received my undergraduate degree from UCLA in Computational Social Science through an 
[Individual Field of Concentration](http://www.honors.ucla.edu/other-programs/design-your-own-major/#) major.
