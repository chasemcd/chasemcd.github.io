# Welcome

My name is Chase McDonald and I am an undergraduate at UCLA. I study computational social science through an Individual Field of Concentration major. I am interested in each distinct discipline that contributes to computational social science, e.g. statistics, computer science, and the social sciences. In their union, my primary focus is on multi-agent systems, behavior, and the link between autonomous and empirical decision-making.  <br/>
