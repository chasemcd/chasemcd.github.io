# Welcome

My name is Chase McDonald and I am a Social and Decision Sciences PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. <br/>

<br/>

I received my undergraduate degree from UCLA in Computational Social Science through an Individual Field of Concentration major. My primary focus was on artificial social intelligence, multi-agent systems, and decision-making. The degree culminated with a thesis that explored the emergence of inter- and intra-group norms under discrimination in mutli-agent reinforcement learning systems.  <br/>
