# Welcome!
<br/>

My name is Chase McDonald and I am a Social and Decision Sciences PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University.

<br/>

I received my undergraduate degree from UCLA in Computational Social Science through an Individual Field of Concentration major. My primary focus was on multi-agent systems and the connections to artificial (social) intelligence, cognition, and decision-making. The degree culminated with a thesis that explored the emergence of inter- and intra-group norms under discrimination in mutli-agent reinforcement learning systems.  <br/>
